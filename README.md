## 🎓 ***BotClusters v7.5***

Have you encountered the problem where you have to host less resource intense Telegram Bots for free and you can only host a bot for an account but you wanted to host all bots in one instance, well say no more...

You can run multiple bots in a same instance, for now it only works for pure python bots (no docker support yet) but you need to host this on services which provide Docker support.
